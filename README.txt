# Responsive Multi-Page Website

This project is a simple responsive website containing three pages: **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**. 
The website is styled using custom CSS (without any frameworks), and it includes media queries for responsive design with two breakpoints.

The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
The website is responsive with the following two breakpoints:

1. First Breakpoint (Max Width: 768px)**  
   - For tablets and medium-sized screens.  
   - Changes include making the navigation items stack vertically and adjusting the width of the content.

2. Second Breakpoint (Max Width: 480px)**  
   - For mobile devices and small screens.  
   - Further adjustments to padding and layout. Including making the form's submit button span the full width of the screen.
